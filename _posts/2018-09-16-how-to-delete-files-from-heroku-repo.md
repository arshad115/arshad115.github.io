It's frustrating when you push some code to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and some files are just not deleted and [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) serves you an old version of your code with a mix of new files. Well, worry no more! You can simply delete the old files on your [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) app using this [Heroku repo](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo) plugin developed by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) .

It's very easy to use and you can delete or reset your app in just two lines of code.

### Heroku repo plugin

1. Install the plugin using:

   ```javascript
   heroku plugins:install heroku-repo
   ```

2. Reset repo using:
   ```javascript
   heroku repo:reset -a appname
   ```

Now your [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) will be just as new. Push your code and it will be like, you just pushed some code to a new app. Cheers!
