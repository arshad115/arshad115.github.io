A long time ago, I had made an account on [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) exchange and my account was already verified. Today the price of Bitcoin fell down to €8,376 on Coinbase and I thought of this a good opportunity to buy Bitcoin. Transferring funds via bank takes a long time, so I decide to use my credit card to buy BTC for €1000. 
The [Coinbase website mentions the credit card fees](https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2109597-coinbase-pricing-fees-disclosures) as 3.99%
So 4% of €1000 is €40 and I expected to pay the same amount.

At the time of making the transaction, the price for Bitcoin was €8,413. When I clicked preview it showed the right amount of BTC and I executed the transaction. Instantly, I get an email that my transaction has been executed at the "Exchange rate	@ €8,568.02 / BTC" **WHAT?!!! This exchange rate is more than €155 more than the current rate!**

This means that Coinbase lied to me and charged me almost €20 more, which makes the total profit for Coinbase at 6%. If you include the fees and the amount of BTC I got in return, they sold the BTC at a rate of €8910, which is around €500 more than the current rate. So much for making profits, these guys are making the real profits.

To my dismay, it didn't end there! Now, I thought, never ever will I buy again from Coinbase with a credit card, let me just transfer my Bitcoin to my hardware wallet. I try to transfer and suddenly get an email saying "Unfortunately, your withdrawal of 0.11220372 BTC on August 29, 2019 at 11:21am CEST has been delayed." WTF! My account is already verified and now I can't even take out my *lost* money? Who are they trying to fool? They're just sitting on your money even after making huge profits. No wonder their sleazy business practices have made them in to a $8 Billion company. This [reddit user](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/cwavwj/btc_withdrawal_72hrs_waiting_for_clearance/eyb59ms/) put it correctly:

They say on their site that I can accelerate the transfer, but I don't have time for their stupid games. The internet is full of examples how they treat their customers. I will just wait for a couple days to receive my funds and never ever use Coinbase again. I suggest, you do the same as I won't trust them again with my money. Neither should you!
