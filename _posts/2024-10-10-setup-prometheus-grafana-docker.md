There are probably thousands of tutorials on setting up Prometheus & Grafana out there; This is probably the most basic one, with one-liners to get you started.

### Prometheus
Prometheus is for gathering metrics and Grafana is for the visualization of the gathered metrics.
`prometheus.yml` contains the configuration for Prometheus and the targets urlâ€™s where the metrics can be collected. Check out the [example file](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/documentation/examples/prometheus.yml). We want this file to be stored outside of Docker, on the host computer and we will bind-mount this file on the host, to the Prometheus Docker container.
To run the container use this command:

```bash
docker run \
    -p 9090:9090 \
    -v /path/to/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    prom/prometheus

```

Make sure to place the `prometheus.yml` file in your path and also change the path. Now Prometheus should be running on the port 9090 on your host.
More detailed info can be found [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/)

#### Grafana
We use Grafana to create beautiful Dashboards to visualize the metrics collected with Prometheus.

##### Run the Grafana Docker container
Start the Docker container by binding Grafana to external port 3000.

```bash
docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana

```
The default admin user credentials are admin/admin.

##### Add the Prometheus Data Source

The good thing about Grafana is that there are numerous Dashboards which can be easily [imported](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/import-dashboards/) and used right away.
