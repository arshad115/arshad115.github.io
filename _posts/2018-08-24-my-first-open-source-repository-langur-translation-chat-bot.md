Sometime ago, I made a chatbot from translating one language to another called [Langur](https://arshadmehmood.com/development/langur-language-translation-bot/). Today, I have decided to make it open source, so that people can learn from it and make chat bots easily. It's my very first open source repository and way of contributing to the open source community. The bot is live and it has some channels linked to it, you can test it in the demo section. It's really simple and anyone can do. You will find the [Language translation chat bot on Github](https://github.com/arshad115/langur-translation-bot). Here is a little intro about what it does and how to use it.

Langur is a translation chat bot made with [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)  and a free [Google translate Api](https://github.com/matheuss/google-translate-api). You can read more about it on my [blog](https://arshadmehmood.com/development/langur-language-translation-bot/).

### How it works:
In the beginning, the bot asks you for your source and target language and then it translates whatever you type into it. 



### To run:

> Install dependencies:
```js
npm install
```

> Insert your `appId` and `appPassword`
> After installing the dependcies, [create a bot](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new) on the Microsoft Bot framework. Get the `appId` and the `appPassword`. Replace these values here:

```js

var keys = require('./keys.js'); //Remove it, used only to import appId and appPassword

// Create chat connector for communicating with the Bot Framework Service
var connector = new builder.ChatConnector({
    appId: keys.appId, //Replace with App Id from your Microsoft bot
    appPassword: keys.appPassword //Replace with App Password from your Microsoft bot
});

```
Or create a file named: `keys.js` and export these values. 

> Run the app
```js
node app.js
```
