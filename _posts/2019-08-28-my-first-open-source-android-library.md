I have a lot of Android applications and a long time ago, I thought to cross promote my apps from insid my app. The first idea was to directly link to the Google play store page of my developer account, but I wanted more control over it and decided to make a simple JSON based RESTful API to send a list of apps and view it inside my app. This way I can also control which apps to show in which app. e.g. food related apps inside my recipe app.
Inside the JSON, you can write your own title, description and even give your own icon - all of these can be different than the play store link.

You can view the [Crosspromote](https://github.com/kookydroid-apps/crosspromote) library and view the instructions, on how to integrate it in your project.
The apps look like this inside your app:
<div align="center">

</div>

Feel free to use it and give me feedback about it.
