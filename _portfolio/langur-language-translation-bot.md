Langur is a translation chat bot made with [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/) with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)  and a free [Google translate Api](https://github.com/matheuss/google-translate-api). I made it as project to get started with chatbots and then later, I made it opensource. Source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/arshad115/langur-translation-bot). You can read more about it and how to run it, on my [blog](https://arshadmehmood.com/development/my-first-open-source-repository-langur-translation-chat-bot/).

### How it works:
In the beginning, the bot asks you for your source and target language and then it translates whatever you type into it.
